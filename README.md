# what is this?
This repository lets you unblock games or other sites very easily.

# How to set it up?
First fork this repository and go over to Config.json and add the url you want to unblock. Make sure to include https:// or it will not work.

# Whats next? 
Head over to a node.js deploying service such as railway or replit and deploy from this repository that you forked. After that run it and get the public url. If you are using railway click the unblocked-proxymaker button on the screen in the replit and then click the settings button that pops up. Go down to public and click generate domain, you need to use port 8080. You may need a new domain if the railway domain is blocked so grab a $1 domain from Namecheap and connect it to railway.

# It is working!
